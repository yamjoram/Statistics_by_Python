Standard deviation : It basically check how far, a value is from the mean i.e from the centre of the data

#SD for Population
import numpy as np
values = [4,11,7,14]
x = np.std(values)

#SD for sample
values = [4,11,7,14]
import numpy as np
x = np.std(values, ddof=1)


Key takeaway:

Use ddof=0 if you have data for the entire population.
Use ddof=1 (the default for most statistical analyses) if you have a sample of data.
